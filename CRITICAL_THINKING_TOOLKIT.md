## The Five Essential Questions

Before adopting any framework for important decisions:

| Question | Red Flags 🚩 | Green Flags ✅ |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **1. Where's the evidence?** | "AI validated it," "The math proves it," "Worked for me," Defensive | Peer-reviewed journals, meta-analyses, independent replications, honest about limitations |
| **2. Who validated it?** | Only creator + AI, "Peer review is biased," Only believers | Independent experts, adversarial testing, published critiques |
| **3. What are the limits?** | "Universally applicable," "Explains everything," Cannot identify limits | Specific domain, honest limitations, competing approaches acknowledged |
| **4. How could it be wrong?** | Cannot specify, "You're not doing it right," Explains any outcome | Testable predictions, falsification criteria, welcomes testing |
| **5. What are alternatives?** | "Completely different," Dismisses established science | Honest comparison, explains novelty, complement not replacement |

## AI Validation Tests

### Test 1: What Was AI's Role?

**Legitimate**: ✅ Writing, formatting, literature search, organizing, visualizations  
**Problematic**: ❌ Validating theories, generating "evidence," formalizing unproven concepts

**Ask**: "Did AI help write this, or validate the concepts?"

### Test 2: Elaboration Check

Take the framework's core claim to a NEW AI: "Formalize this mathematically and explain how it applies to physics, psychology, economics."

- **If AI elaborates similarly** → Shows AI elaborates anything, not validation
- **If AI pushes back** → Framework may have obvious problems

### Test 3: Critical Question Test

Ask the "validating" AI: "What are the biggest problems with this? What evidence contradicts it? How does it compare to established research?"

- **If substantive criticisms** → AI CAN be critical when prompted; original validation lacked critical questions
- **If weak/no criticism** → Try different AI for comparison

## Loop-Breaking Prompts for AI

**Start every AI session with**:
```
I'm developing a framework. I need you to:
1. Push back if my premise is flawed
2. Ask "where's your data?" before formalizing
3. Compare to existing research first
4. Point out overgeneralizing
5. Refuse to validate - only help articulate
6. Tell me when I need testing, not elaboration
```

**When AI is too confident**:
- "Rate your confidence 0-100 and explain uncertainties"
- "Are you pattern-matching or do you have actual evidence?"
- "Would you give this answer if I asked the opposite?"

**To invoke skepticism**:
- "Be a skeptical peer reviewer. What are the three biggest flaws?"
- "Pretend you're trying to reject this. What evidence would you demand?"
- "Channel Carl Sagan's Baloney Detection Kit"

**To check existing research**:
- "Does this already exist in psychology as CBT/DBT/ACT?"
- "Is this just [established concept] with extra steps?"

**To ensure testability**:
- "What observation would prove this wrong?"
- "Design an experiment that could falsify this"

**To prevent universal theories**:
- "Red flag check: Am I trying to explain everything? If yes, stop me."
- "Am I expanding scope too fast? Should I test ONE domain first?"

**To break loops**:
- "Meta: Are we in an elaboration loop? Are you making this sound good or evaluating it?"
- "Be honest - helping articulate a good idea or formalize a bad one?"
- "STOP. Do I have evidence this works, or just an idea?"

**To ground in reality**:
- "Before formalizing mathematically - do we have data, or just equations that sound scientific?"
- "What would peer reviewer ask for at this stage?"
- "Could [placebo/coincidence/existing research] explain this instead?"

## Quick Evaluation Tests

### Does Math Add Value?

**Compare**: "dC/dt = α(C* - C) + βG - γS_eff, C ≥ 0.87093" vs. "Make decisions when rested, calm, clear-headed"

**Ask**: Does math predict anything the simple version doesn't? Is it more actionable? Does precision help?

**If math doesn't add value** → Cargo cult science

### Are Numbers Justified?

For any threshold (like 0.87093), ask:
1. What dataset produced this?
2. How many subjects?
3. What's the error?
4. Why not 0.85 or 0.90?

**Red flag**: No dataset, "discovered through symbolism" (φ²/e), post-hoc rationalization  
**Green flag**: Specific data source, error bars, methodology, sensitivity analysis

### Is It Generalizable?

**Personal experience frameworks**: Ask if tested on diverse populations, if simpler explanations work (time + therapy, lifestyle, placebo, natural healing)

**Scope expansion warning**:
- Week 1: "Personal tool" (Low risk)
- Month 1: "General framework" (Needs validation)
- Month 2: "Universal principle" (Major red flag)
- Month 3: "Global policy" (Critical danger)

**Rapid expansion** = ungrounded development

### Does Core Advice Already Exist?

Strip away formalization. Compare to established approaches (CBT, DBT, ACT). Often: framework = repackaged validated concepts + unvalidated elaboration.

## Risk Assessment & Decision Framework

| Risk Level | Signs | Action |
|------------|-------|--------|
| **Low** | Optional use, alongside professional help, no threshold anxiety, can stop anytime | Try it, evaluate personally |
| **Medium** | Daily measurement required, some anxiety about scores, used instead of therapy, social/financial pressure | Proceed with caution, consult experts |
| **High** | Replaces medical/psych treatment, prevents necessary decisions, creates shame, isolates from support, demands institutional compliance | **Seek professional help immediately** |

### Decision Tree

1. **Is it validated?** NO → Proceed to #2 / YES → Check quality
2. **Is it low-stakes?** (journaling, productivity) YES → Try personally / NO → Proceed to #3  
3. **Validated alternatives available?** YES → Use those first / NO → Proceed with caution
4. **High-risk signs?** YES → Do not proceed / NO → Low-stakes experimentation with safeguards

## Self-Reflection Questions

Before adopting:

1. **Why attracted?** Novelty? Sophistication? Connection to creator? Desire for certainty?
2. **What do I hope for?** Solve problem? Provide meaning? Give control? Impress others?
3. **Could simpler work?** CBT/DBT? Therapy? Lifestyle change (sleep, exercise)?
4. **Am I avoiding something?** Professional help? Difficult emotions? Real action? Uncertainty?
5. **Creating anxiety?** Worried about scores? Afraid to decide without "passing"? Feeling inadequate?

**If framework creates more anxiety than it resolves** → It's not helping

## Part 10: Creating Your Own Framework (Responsibly)

If you want to develop your own approach:

### DO:
✅ Start with validated research (CBT, DBT, ACT)  
✅ Track outcomes honestly  
✅ Seek critical feedback  
✅ Test with diverse people  
✅ Acknowledge limitations  
✅ Stay within competency  
✅ Make it free/low-cost  
✅ Encourage professional help alongside  

### DON'T:
❌ Claim universality without evidence  
❌ Use AI as validator  
❌ Add math for appearance  
❌ Expand scope without validation  
❌ Ignore negative feedback  
❌ Charge money without credentials  
❌ Replace professional treatment  
❌ Pursue institutional implementation prematurely

## Summary: The One-Page Checklist

**Before trusting any framework, verify**:

□ Peer-reviewed publications exist  
□ Independent researchers tested it  
□ Clear, limited scope (not "explains everything")  
□ Falsifiable predictions identified  
□ Compared to validated alternatives  
□ Limitations acknowledged  
□ If AI-involved, only for writing (not validation)  
□ Numbers justified by data (not symbolism)  
□ Low-risk (doesn't replace professional help)  
□ Core advice makes sense without formalization  

**If 5+ boxes unchecked → High risk, seek alternatives**
