## Case Examples

### Example 1: Decision-Making Under Stress

#### AI-Generated Approach (VEF-style)
**Framework**:
```
dC/dt = α(C* - C) + βG - γS_eff + ηA - δ
Decision allowed when C ≥ 0.87093
Six-gate Realness protocol required
Daily MCL logging mandatory
```

**Core advice**: Don't make decisions when stressed; wait until coherent state

**Development**: 2-3 months with AI collaboration

**Evidence**: Personal use + AI validation

**Cost**: Free (self-administered)

---

#### Evidence-Based Approach (CBT/DBT)
**Framework**:
- Identify cognitive distortions
- Challenge automatic thoughts  
- Practice behavioral experiments
- Develop emotion regulation skills

**Core advice**: Notice when stress affects thinking; use specific techniques to respond skillfully

**Development**: 40+ years of research, thousands of studies

**Evidence**: Meta-analyses show effectiveness for anxiety, depression, many conditions

**Cost**: $100-200/session with trained therapist (but also self-help books, apps)

---

**Comparison**:
- ✅ **Core advice is similar** (both recognize stress affects decisions)
- ❌ **VEF adds mathematical formalism** without adding value
- ✅ **CBT/DBT has decades of validation** VEF has none
- ❌ **VEF's thresholds are arbitrary** (0.87093)
- ✅ **CBT/DBT is delivered by trained professionals** with oversight

**Bottom line**: CBT/DBT accomplishes the same goal with evidence backing it.

---

### Example 2: Rumination and Thought Loops

#### AI-Generated Approach
**Framework**:
- Mann-Kendall trend test on coherence time series
- Theil-Sen slope estimator
- Loop detection via variance analysis
- SAP-6 protocol when detected

**Core advice**: Notice when you're stuck in negative thought patterns; take action to break the loop

**Math**: Statistical tests on self-reported metrics

**Evidence**: None (personal framework)

---

#### Evidence-Based Approach (MBCT - Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy)
**Framework**:
- Mindfulness meditation
- Recognize rumination as mental event (not truth)
- Shift attention to present moment
- Decentering from thoughts

**Core advice**: Notice when you're stuck in negative thought patterns; practice present-moment awareness

**Math**: None needed

**Evidence**: 
- Meta-analyses show 43% reduction in depression relapse
- Tested across 9 RCTs with 1,258 participants
- Endorsed by NICE (UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence)

---

**Comparison**:
- ✅ **Core insight is the same** (noticing rumination is key)
- ❌ **AI framework adds statistical tests** that don't improve outcomes
- ✅ **MBCT has clear evidence** of effectiveness
- ❌ **VEF's Mann-Kendall test** is sophisticated but unnecessary
- ✅ **MBCT can be learned** from books, apps, or 8-week courses

**Bottom line**: MBCT delivers same benefit without elaborate formalization, with evidence backing it.

---

### Example 3: Personal Values and Decision-Making

#### AI-Generated Approach
**Framework**:
- Motivational Alignment (M_ij) ≥ 0.70 threshold
- Conceptual Clarity (CC) ≥ 0.80 threshold
- Knowledge Coherence (K_ij) ≥ 0.60 threshold
- Six-gate Realness protocol
- Daily numerical tracking

**Core advice**: Make sure decisions align with your values and you have sufficient information

**Precision**: Three decimal places (0.70, 0.80, 0.60)

**Evidence**: None beyond personal use

---

#### Evidence-Based Approach (ACT - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy)
**Framework**:
- Clarify personal values
- Notice when behavior diverges from values
- Accept difficult emotions
- Commit to value-aligned action
- Practice psychological flexibility

**Core advice**: Make sure decisions align with your values; accept discomfort as part of meaningful action

**Precision**: None needed (qualitative assessment)

**Evidence**:
- 300+ RCTs across diverse conditions
- Meta-analyses show moderate to large effects
- Used for anxiety, depression, chronic pain, substance use

---

**Comparison**:
- ✅ **Both emphasize values alignment**
- ❌ **AI framework adds arbitrary thresholds** (why 0.70 and not 0.68?)
- ✅ **ACT has extensive validation**
- ❌ **Daily numerical tracking** may increase anxiety rather than reduce it
- ✅ **ACT is flexible** (no rigid thresholds)

**Bottom line**: ACT provides same values-based approach with flexibility and evidence.

---

## Common Patterns

### What AI-Generated Frameworks Often Do:
1. **Repackage validated concepts** from CBT, DBT, ACT, mindfulness
2. **Add mathematical formalization** (equations, thresholds, gates)
3. **Create elaborate measurement systems** (daily tracking, numerical scores)
4. **Claim universal applicability** (consciousness, physics, economics)
5. **Provide false precision** (0.87093 instead of "roughly 0.85-0.90")
6. **Lack independent validation** (only creator + AI)

### What Evidence-Based Frameworks Do:
1. **Build on decades of research** with incremental improvements
2. **Use math only when necessary** (e.g., for statistical analysis of trials)
3. **Focus on practical skills** (not daily measurement)
4. **Make conservative claims** (specific conditions, populations)
5. **Acknowledge uncertainty** (confidence intervals, effect sizes)
6. **Welcome independent testing** and criticism
